# RDataProduct

Hi, here is the server.R and ui.R code for my Shiny product.

I basically made a BMI calculator that also plots out where the participant stands relative to the US population in 2005. I would have used 2014 data but I was not sure how to extract it.
Hope you find it interesting enough!
